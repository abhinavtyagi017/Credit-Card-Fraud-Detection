# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using various data analysis techniques. Credit card fraud is a significant issue, and accurate detection can help prevent losses for banks and customers. In this project, we analyze a dataset to build a model that can identify fraudulent transactions.

#Introduction

Credit card fraud detection involves analyzing transactions to identify potentially fraudulent activity. The goal of this project is to use data analysis techniques to detect fraudulent transactions in a dataset. We'll explore the dataset, clean the data, perform feature engineering, and use machine learning models to predict fraud.
